Project Description:
Our project is a trip planning website that lets the user plan their trips. Specifically:
- The user can add a trip in ht Plan a Trip page. 
  By providing a location on the map, a photo url, start date, and end date, the trip will be added to the home page.
- The home page has all the trips that the user has added. They can be filtered and deleted as well.
- Lastly there is a gallery page that has all the photos uploaded in a slide show.
